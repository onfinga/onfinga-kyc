# Onfinga KYC – Progress Tracker

📆 **Last Updated:** 2025-09-05  

---

## ✅ Completed Milestones

### Phase 1: Backend Core (Flask + PostgreSQL)
- Set up Flask backend with factory pattern (`create_app`).
- Configured SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, and PostgreSQL connection.
- Created models:
  - `User`
  - `KYCSession`
  - `KYCSubmission`
- Implemented migrations and upgraded database schema.
- Built core routes:
  - `/kyc/start` → Start new KYC session
  - `/kyc/status/<session_id>` → Get KYC status
  - `/kyc/update/<session_id>` → Approve/Reject KYC
  - `/kyc/list` → List all sessions for a user
- Added stricter validation, structured error codes, and error handling.

### Phase 2: Admin Panel
- Integrated **Flask-Admin**.
- Secured it with **Basic Auth** (`SecureModelView`).
- Added filtering, searching, and restricted actions in the admin panel.
- Confirmed panel working at `/admin`.

### Phase 3: Frontend MVP (React + Vite)
- Bootstrapped React frontend inside `/frontend`.
- Implemented components:
  - `StartKYC.jsx` → Starts a new session
  - `CheckStatus.jsx` → Polls and displays session status
  - `UpdateStatus.jsx` → Approve/Reject status for testing
- Styled with `App.css`.
- Verified integration with backend.

### Phase 4: Repo & Deployment
- Initialized GitHub repo: [onfinga-kyc](https://github.com/onfinga/onfinga-kyc).
- Created `.env` and added to `.gitignore`.
- Added `requirements.txt` for backend dependencies.
- Started preparing `render.yaml` for deployment.

---

## 🚧 In Progress

- Backend Hardening: enforce HTTPS for production (pending Render deployment).
- Migration fixes for `user_id` foreign key refactor.
- Deployment pipeline setup on Render.

---

## 🎯 Next Milestones

1. **Backend Hardening (Finish)**
   - Finalize `user_id` foreign key migration.
   - Ensure all input validation is bulletproof.

2. **Deployment**
   - Debug Render build pipeline.
   - Ensure `requirements.txt` + `render.yaml` configured properly.
   - Deploy backend + frontend.

3. **MVP Validation**
   - End-to-end flow: user email → KYC session → admin approval → frontend reflects status.
   - Add basic frontend error handling.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Placeholder user in DB: `placeholder@onfinga.com`.
- Admin credentials in `.env`:
  - `ADMIN_USERNAME=admin`
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret123`
- Known bug: React UI shows white text on white background for session IDs (fixed via styling).

## Milestone A — Backend Hardening ✅ (Completed)
**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

- Enforce stricter input validation (user_id/email) ✅
- Error handling & 404s for missing sessions ✅
- Structured error codes returned by all endpoints ✅
- HTTPS in production via Render’s managed TLS ✅

**Notes:**
- `/kyc/start` now validates input and supports email→user mapping.
- All endpoints return `{ error, code }` consistently for failures.
- No code-based redirects needed; Render terminates TLS at the edge.


## 🔐 Repo & GitHub Setup

- Added `.gitignore` to keep repo clean.
- Switched from HTTPS → SSH for GitHub authentication.
- Generated and registered SSH key (`id_ed25519`) with GitHub.
- Verified connection: `ssh -T git@github.com` works without password.

✅ This ensures smooth commits/pushes without entering credentials each time.
