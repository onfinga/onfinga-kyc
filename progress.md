# Onfinga KYC – Progress Tracker

📆 **Last Updated:** 2025-09-11

---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Core (Flask + PostgreSQL)
- Set up Flask backend with factory pattern (`create_app`).
- Configured SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, and PostgreSQL connection.
- Created models:
  - `User`
  - `KYCSession`
  - `KYCSubmission`
- Implemented migrations and upgraded database schema.
- Built core routes:
  - `/kyc/start` → Start new KYC session
  - `/kyc/status/<session_id>` → Get KYC status
  - `/kyc/update/<session_id>` → Approve/Reject KYC
  - `/kyc/list` → List all sessions for a user
- Added stricter validation, structured error codes, and error handling.

### Phase 2: Admin Panel
- Integrated **Flask-Admin**.
- Secured it with **Basic Auth** (`SecureModelView`).
- Added filtering, searching, and restricted actions in the admin panel.
- Confirmed panel working at `/admin`.

### Phase 3: Frontend MVP (React + Vite)
- Bootstrapped React frontend inside `/frontend`.
- Implemented components:
  - `StartKYC.jsx` → Starts a new session
  - `CheckStatus.jsx` → Polls and displays session status
  - `UpdateStatus.jsx` → Approve/Reject status for testing
- Styled with `App.css`.
- Verified integration with backend.

### Phase 4: Repo & Deployment
- Initialized GitHub repo: [onfinga-kyc](https://github.com/onfinga/onfinga-kyc).
- Created `.env` and added to `.gitignore`.
- Added `requirements.txt` for backend dependencies.
- Started preparing `render.yaml` for deployment.

---

## 🚧 In Progress
- Migration fixes for `user_id` foreign key refactor.
- Deployment pipeline setup on Render.

---

## 🎯 Next Phases
1. **Deployment**
   - Debug Render build pipeline.
   - Ensure `requirements.txt` + `render.yaml` configured properly.
   - Deploy backend + frontend.

2. **MVP Validation**
   - End-to-end flow: user email → KYC session → admin approval → frontend reflects status.
   - Add basic frontend error handling.

---

## 📌 Notes
- Placeholder user in DB: `placeholder@onfinga.com`.
- Admin credentials in `.env`:
  - `ADMIN_USERNAME=admin`
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret123`
- Known bug: React UI shows white text on white background for session IDs (fixed via styling).

---

## 🏁 Milestones Summary

### Milestone A — Backend Hardening ✅ (2025-09-05)
- Enforce stricter input validation (user_id/email)  
- Error handling & 404s for missing sessions  
- Structured error codes returned by all endpoints  
- HTTPS in production via Render’s managed TLS  

### Milestone B — Environment Cleanup ✅ (2025-09-05)
- Added `.env.example` to repo  
- Added `.gitignore` rules for Python, frontend, and OS junk  
- Removed hardcoded fallbacks from `config.py`  

### Milestone C — Production Readiness ✅ (2025-09-05)
- Restricted CORS to `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` only  
- Runtime checks for env vars (`SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`)  
- Health check endpoint (`/health`) added  
- Confirmed environment loads correctly  

---

## Milestone D — MVP Validation ✅ (Completed)
**Date:** 2025-09-07

**What works end-to-end**
- Start KYC by email → creates `KYCSession (pending)`
- Check status by `session_id`
- Update status (approve/reject) via endpoint / admin
- List sessions by `email` or `user_id`
- React UI: Start, Status, Update flows with clear feedback

**Notes**
- Admin panel reachable at `/admin` (Basic Auth)
- CORS restricted to `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`
- Health check at `/health`

Bridge from internal MVP → market-ready demo, secure first pilot commitments.

---

### ✅ Day 1 – Foundation + Outreach Kickoff
- [x] Finalize affordability check mock integration (dummy bank data / sandbox).
- [x] Ensure API outputs `affordability_score` + `decision`.
- [x] Draft Onfinga KYC 1-pager (problem, solution, BNPL pain, how we help).
- [ ] Reach out to 10 SME retailers from database (personalized).

---

### ✅ Day 2 – UI/UX Polish + Retailer Engagement
- [ ] Improve error messages, add branding (logo/colors).
- [ ] Record 2-min demo video of Onfinga flow.
- [ ] Share demo video privately with 3–5 friendly retailers, ask for feedback.

---

### ✅ Day 3 – Outreach & Storytelling
- [ ] Add admin summary view (affordability score + decision).
- [ ] Prepare slides: “How BNPL retailers lose money” → tie to Onfinga.
- [ ] Email 20 more SMEs (tweak for verticals).
- [ ] Reach out to BNPLs (Payflex, PayJustNow) for partnerships.

---

### ✅ Day 4 – Market Validation
- [ ] Add demo webhook simulation (mock truID call).
- [ ] Draft data policy (“Onfinga stores zero financial data”).
- [ ] Book 2–3 SME retailer calls from outreach.
- [ ] Ask pain questions (defaults, willingness to pay for instant checks).

---

### ✅ Day 5 – Refinement + Scaling Outreach
- [ ] Polish demo flow (error handling, UX smoothness).
- [ ] Build landing page (Carrd/Framer).
- [ ] Bulk outreach to 50 SMEs.
- [ ] Update CRM sheet (opens, replies, calls booked).

---

### ✅ Day 6 – Pilot Prep
- [ ] Lock in demo accounts (sandbox).
- [ ] Run 2–3 live demos with friendly SMEs (Zoom/Loom).
- [ ] Draft pilot pricing (e.g., R10/check, first 50 free).
- [ ] Secure first paying pilot.

---

### ✅ Day 7 – Review + Next Sprint Planning
- [ ] Fix bugs + cleanup.
- [ ] Write technical doc (how SMEs integrate Onfinga).
- [ ] Review outreach metrics.
- [ ] Identify top 5 warmest leads, push to pilot.
- [ ] Plan Sprint 2 (truID integration + pilot rollouts).

---

### 🏆 Expected Sprint Outcomes
By Sept 17, 2025 we will have:
1. Demo-ready product with mock affordability checks.
2. Clean UI/UX + demo video.
3. At least 100 SMEs reached out to.
4. 3–5 discovery calls booked.
5. 1 pilot partner committed.
